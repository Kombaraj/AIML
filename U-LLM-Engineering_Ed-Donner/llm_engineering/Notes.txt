        Understanding LLM Parameters 
            Parameters are the weights in the neural network that the model learns during training.
            The more parameters a model has, the more complex patterns and relationships it can potentially understand and generate.
        GPT Tokens
            A token is the basic unit of text that the model processes. Tokens are essentially chunks of text that can represent words, parts of words, or even punctuation marks, depending on how the text is tokenized.

        Context Window
            The context window refers to the maximum amount of text, measured in tokens, that the model can process at one time when generating or understanding language.
        Costs
            Chat Interfaces have plans with monthly subscription
            APIs typically have no subscription, but charge per API call. The cost is based on the number if input tokens & output tokens
